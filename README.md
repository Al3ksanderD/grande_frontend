# Welcome to Fitness Oasis
To this moment, this is one of my biggest projects and the one that Iâ€™m most proud of. Fitness Oasis is a platform that helps fitness enthusiasts easily find and reserve appointments with their favorite personal trainers, dieticians, physiotherapists, and more. The platform is straightforward and very easy to use. On Fitness Oasis, you can manage your reservations, reserve new ones, pay for them, and do anything that is needed to get the best fitness reservation experience.



## Functionality
- User authentication
- Email service (such as for confirming your new account)
- Security features
- Adding/deleting/modifying reservations
- Roles (such as user/company owner/company employee)
- Nice aesthetics
- User-friendly interface
- Custom logo


## What's Next?
In the future, I plan to introduce a simple checkout system after confirming your reservation, improve the aesthetics of the front-end a little bit more, and improve the security layer of the project.
